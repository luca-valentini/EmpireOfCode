#Triangle Angles

Most of the facets on a crystal are triangle. Since these crystals are vital to our base, we should attempt to learn more about this shape.

You are given the lengths for each side of a triangle. You need to find all three of the angles for this triangle. If the given side lengths cannot form a triangle (or form a degenerated triangle), then you must return all angles as 0 (zero). The angles should be represented as a list of integers in ascending order. Each angle is measured in degrees and rounded to the nearest integer number using standard mathematical rounding.

###Input: The lengths of the sides of a triangle as integers.

###Output: Angles of a triangle in degrees as sorted list of integers.

###Example:
```javascript
angles(4, 4, 4) == [60, 60, 60]
angles(3, 4, 5) == [37, 53, 90]
angles(2, 2, 5) == [0, 0, 0]
```
###Precondition:

0 < a ≤ 1000

0 < b ≤ 1000

0 < c ≤ 1000

###How it is used:

This is a classical geometry problem. With this concept you can measure an angle without the need for a protractor for use in fields such as topography or architecture.
